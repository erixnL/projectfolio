This project takes inspiration from my own learning journey and university student project experiences.
The initial structure and coding logic of the project took shape following a helpful tutorial on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/php-from-scratch-course/?couponCode=OPPPOT42722. Subsequently, I applied my insights to refactor and modify the project, infusing it with my own project ideas.
